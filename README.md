A demo sidebar menu mad with React.js. 

Functionality wise:
1. A full span vertical button toggles between detailed view and icon view of our menu.
2. When a mouse pointer is hovered over an icon, it reveals the submenu for that icon/choice.

This has been demonstrated with just one icon/choice. i.e. Product which is second in place.

Room for improvements:

1. When in expanded mode, above mentioned submenu shoould lodge itself with the sidebar and appear right below the icon/choice pair.
2. Iconview and menu should split in order to accomodate the submenu.
3. Footer icons/options will get reduced to horizontal formation and options will disappear leaving just icons in the footer.
4. Transitions should be made more fluid and desirable for the user. react-motion might help.
